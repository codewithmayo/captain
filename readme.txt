                        CHANGING THE API KEYS and Voices

2. Don't change the name of the of the variable only change the value next to "equal" sign.

2. Press CTRL + F  and paste "myMessages.append"

3.You will see this type of line in the results --->   myMessages.append({"role": "system", "content": 'Identity: You are Captain, a retired army....

4. The prompt is starting from the "Identity" word and all to the end until you see another "myMessages.append"
5. You can get an idea from the current prompt that is set like where its starting and where its ending.

6. The prompt is wrapped inside single quotation marks ( ‘ ’ ) so you can't use these single quotation marks 
inside your prompt. If you do you will get errors. You can use double quotation marks ( "" ) to highlight things
inside prompt.

7. Be very careful doing this even a single type could cause app failure.
